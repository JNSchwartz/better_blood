\begin{abstract}
The most efficient healthcare method is prevention. Blood samples are a great but costly way to eliminate serious issues early. One of the blood analyzes includes analysis of the white blood cells (WBCs later). Image prediction has developed significantly with Deep Learning. There are studies processing WBCs pretty efficiently. They include some machine learning models which could further optimized and we improved them with the newest version and combinations of the models. We also included lower quality images and predicted on those as efficiently as on the base set. This could lead to more frequent and cheaper analysis.

\section{Execution environment}
The training process were conducted on a Windows 11 desktop PC with a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with 16 cores and 32 threads. The CPU was overclocked to a base clock of 4.7 Ghz and we achieved a respectable 5.9 Ghz single core boost performance. The PC had 16GBs of DDR4-4400 RAM, and a CUDA enabled Nvidia GeForce GTX rtx 3090 GPU with 24 GBs of Video RAM (VRAM). Our system consumed 900W of power. The network design, testing, training, and the final experimentation process were performed using the MATLAB R2020b software package.
\section{Results and discussion}

The main objective of this study is to classify WBCs with improved performance while keeping the best possible accuracy while utilizing ResNet50V2 instead of ResNet50 in the classification pipeline discussed earlier (Sec. \ref{methods}) and reducing the number of features needed.
The following subsections contain the outcome and assessment of the performed experiments and they are subsequently explained in detail.

\subsection{Test No. 1 (2100 features)}
This test contains a total of 2100 features with 800 from 4B-AdditionNet, 700 from ResNet50, and 600 from EfficientNetB0. The final feature vector after fusion is of size $9957*2100$. The Cubic SVM classifier achieved an Ac of 97.58\% with a Se of 96.56\%, Sp of 98.24\%, Pr of 94.85\%, and an F1 score of 95.69\%, with a runtime of 174.73 s. Figure \ref{test1} shows the detailed results for all six classifiers, it illustrates the training time and Ac for all six classifiers.

\section{Conclusion}
\section{Future work}

While existing methods already achieved very high accuracy in blood cell classification, other aspects as speed and generality could be still improved as shown by this study. 
Further advances can be made by including and fusing together bigger Blood Cell Images datasets, like LISC, which would include an other type of cell to classify, which could refine our classification method to perform better across diverse datasets.
Performance can also be further improved by using bigger and more diverse datasets and by reducing the
amount of extracted features.
