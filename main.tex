\begin{abstract}
The most efficient healthcare method is prevention. Blood samples are a great but costly way to eliminate serious issues early. One of the blood analyzes includes analysis of the white blood cells (WBCs later). Image prediction has developed significantly with Deep Learning. There are studies processing WBCs pretty efficiently. They include some machine learning models which could further optimized and we improved them with the newest version and combinations of the models. We also included lower quality images and predict on those as efficiently as on the base set. This could lead to more frequent and cheaper analysis.

\section{Future work}

While existing methods already achieved very high accuracy in blood cell classification, other aspects as speed and generality could be still improved as shown by this study. 
Further advances can be made by including and fusing together bigger Blood Cell Images datasets, like LISC, which would include an other type of cell to classify, which could refine our classification method to perform better across diverse datasets.
Performance can also be further improved by using bigger and more diverse datasets and by reducing the
amount of extracted features.
