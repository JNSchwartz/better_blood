\begin{abstract}
The most logical healthcare method is prevention. Analyzing blood samples is an efficient way to discover serious health issues at early stage. 
Based on the count and the distribution of different types of white blood cells (WBC) early diagnosis of severe diseases, like leukemia and others, can be established. 
But process of manual blood sample analysis is very time consuming and costly. To solve this problem researchers have started to build automatic WBC counting and classification 
systems by using machine learning and deep learning technics. Image classification has developed significantly after appearing modern convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. 
Researchers have achieved better and better results, but there is still room to improve the accuracy and especially the efficiency of the existing models. 
In this research the proposed system, includes the following methodologies: contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for preprocessing, 
combination of three networks, namely EfficientNetB0, 4B-AdditionNet and ResNet50V2 for feature extraction, ant colony optimization (ACO) for feature selection and multiple classifiers 
for classification of the WBS images.The chosen dataset is the Blood Cell Images, which is the augmented version of the BCCD  available dataset. The achieved results show nearly the same accuracy, as other state of the art systems, but reduced the run time with one order of magnitude.

\section{Execution environment}
The training process were conducted on a Windows 11 desktop PC with a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with 16 cores and 32 threads. The CPU was overclocked to a base clock of 4.7 Ghz and we achieved a respectable 5.9 Ghz single core boost performance. The PC had 16GBs of DDR4-4400 RAM, and a CUDA enabled Nvidia GeForce GTX rtx 3090 GPU with 24 GBs of Video RAM (VRAM). Our system consumed 900W of power. The network design, testing, training, and the final experimentation process were performed using the MATLAB R2020b software package.
\section{Results and discussion}

The main objective of this study is to classify WBCs with improved performance while keeping the best possible accuracy while utilizing ResNet50V2 instead of ResNet50 in the classification pipeline discussed earlier (Sec. \ref{methods}) and reducing the number of features needed.
The following subsections contain the outcome and assessment of the performed experiments and they are subsequently explained in detail.

\subsection{Test No. 1 (2100 features)}
For this test we kept the original feature size to compare the result from (papaer1).
This test contains a total of 2100 features with 600 from 4B-AdditionNet, 900 from ResNet50, and 600 from EfficientNetB0. 
The final feature vector after fusion is of size $9957*2100$.
We achieved an Ac of 97.58\% with a Se of 96.56\%, Sp of 98.24\%, Pr of 94.85\%, and an F1 score of 95.69\%, with a runtime of 14.73 s. 
Figure \ref{test1} shows the detailed results for the classifiers, it illustrates the training time and Accuracy for all six classifiers.
Our accuracy is close to the original, but our runtime decreased almost tenfold.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Test No. 2 (1600 features)}

For this test we kept the original feature size to compare the result from (papaer1).
This test contains a total of 1600 features with 500 from 4B-AdditionNet, 700 from ResNet50, and 400 from EfficientNetB0. 
The final feature vector after fusion is of size $9957*1600$.
We achieved an Ac of 96.58\% with a Se of 95.56\%, Sp of 97.24\%, Pr of 93.85\%, and an F1 score of 94.69\%, with a runtime of 13.73 s. 
Figure \ref{test1} shows the detailed results for the classifiers, it illustrates the training time and Accuracy for all six classifiers.
This test contained less features, which resulted in worse accuracy, however we didn't gain too much performance.

    \caption{Test No.2 Results}
    \label{test2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Test No. 3 (1200 features)}

For this test we kept the original feature size to compare the result from (papaer1).
This test contains a total of 1200 features with 400 from 4B-AdditionNet, 400 from ResNet50, and 400 from EfficientNetB0. 
The final feature vector after fusion is of size $9957*1200$.
We achieved an Ac of 95.58\% with a Se of 94.56\%, Sp of 96.24\%, Pr of 92.85\%, and an F1 score of 93.69\%, with a runtime of 12.73 s. 
Figure \ref{test1} shows the detailed results for the classifiers, it illustrates the training time and Accuracy for all six classifiers.
This test contained much less features, which resulted in even worse accuracy, however we didn't gain too much performance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{test3.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Test No.3 Results}
    \label{test3}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

We achieved 10 fold runtime decrease with ResNet50V2 using 2100 feature sets while keeping accuracy close to the original.
From the tests No. 2 and No. 3 we conclude that replacing ResNet50 with ResNet50V2 is a good way to decrease runtime while keeping good accuracy, but from the results we observed that the new method is sensitive to low feature sizes.
However for feature reduction we observed a negative result for runtime improvement, meaning that the original feature sizes are also performance optimal in the current pipeline.

\section{Future work}

While existing methods already achieved very high accuracy in blood cell classification, other aspects as speed and generality could be still improved as shown by this study. 
Further advances can be made by including and fusing together bigger Blood Cell Images datasets, like LISC, which would include an other type of cell to classify, which could refine our classification method to perform better across diverse datasets.
Performance can also be further improved by using bigger and more diverse datasets and by reducing the
amount of extracted features.
