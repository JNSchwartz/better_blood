dataset. BCCD is a publicly available dataset which divides blood smear images into three classes: RBC, WBC, and Platelets.
The Blood Cell Images dataset contains 12,500 augmented images of blood smears that are divided into four categories: Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil.
The augmented images have a dimension of 320 x 240 pixels, the bit depth is 24. The images are RGB images, so they have 3 channels and a horizontal and vertical resolution depth of 96 dots per inch (dpi).
