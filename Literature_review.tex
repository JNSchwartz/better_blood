\section{Literature review}
Blood cell classification got great attention from researchers, especially since modern CNN architectures appeared. The number of researches of traditional machine learning and deep learning for leucocytes classification shows exponential growth in recent times

. With modern CNN architectures the accuracy was improved significantly.
Our research is based on
